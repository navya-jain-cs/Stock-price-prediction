# Stock Price Prediction  

This repository contains the implementation of a stock price prediction project, including data collection, preprocessing, and predictive modeling using both machine learning and deep learning techniques.  

## Project Overview  
The **Stock Price Prediction** project focuses on forecasting stock prices using historical stock data. The project involves:  
- Collecting and preprocessing stock data from various sectors using the Yahoo Finance API.  
- Applying machine learning models like **Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**.  
- Building and fine-tuning deep learning models, including **LSTM** and **multi-layer LSTM**, for improved accuracy on time-series data.  
- Comparing model performance to identify the most reliable prediction technique.  

### Key Features:  
- Automated data preprocessing, including outlier removal, normalization, and feature engineering.  
- Implementation of both machine learning and deep learning approaches for a comprehensive analysis.  
- Use of saved models (`.keras`) for seamless future predictions.  

## Results  
- The **LSTM model** achieved an impressive **99.72% accuracy**, demonstrating its robustness in capturing temporal patterns.  
- The **multi-layer LSTM model** performed comparably, offering enhanced depth and complexity for long-term predictions.  
- Machine learning models provided foundational insights but lagged in performance compared to deep learning models.  

These results highlight the effectiveness of deep learning, particularly LSTM architectures, in time-series forecasting tasks like stock price prediction.
